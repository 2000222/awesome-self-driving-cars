## Simulators
* [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) - This simulator is built for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree to teach students how to train cars how to navigate road courses using deep learning. It is used for the project of [Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).
* [Microsoft's AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim) - An open-source and cross platform simulator built for drones and other vehicles. AirSim is designed as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles.

## Courses
* [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) - Udacity's flagship program is sponsored by many self-driving car hiring partners. The nanodegree program includes 3 terms: 1) [Term 1: Computer Vision and Deep Learning](https://medium.com/self-driving-cars/term-1-in-depth-on-udacitys-self-driving-car-curriculum-ffcf46af0c08#.k5745vhdw), 2) [Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control](https://medium.com/udacity/term-2-in-depth-on-udacitys-self-driving-car-curriculum-775130aae502#.oh8xi152p), and 3) Term 3: Path Planning, Elective, and Systems. Each term costs $800.
* [MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) - This class is an introduction to the practice of deep learning through the applied theme of building a self-driving car. It is open to beginners and is designed for those who are new to machine learning, but it can also benefit advanced researchers in the field looking for a practical overview of deep learning methods and their application. By the way, it's free!
